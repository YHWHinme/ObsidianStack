**Main Headline:** Secure Your Self-Hosted AI: Setting Up a Domain and SSL for Open Web UI

**Sub-Headlines:**

* **Headline:**  Open Web UI: The Best Way to Self-Host Your AI?
    * **Snippet:** The video introduces Open Web UI as a powerful tool for self-hosting AI, but highlights the lack of built-in SSL as a major drawback.  The tutorial aims to address this issue by adding a domain name and SSL certificate.
    * **Timestamp:** `[00:00:00 - 00:01:22]`

* **Headline:**  Three Steps to Secure Your Open Web UI
    * **Snippet:** The tutorial outlines three key steps: acquiring a domain name, securing it with an SSL certificate via Cloudflare, and setting up an Nginx Proxy Manager.  Cloudflare is recommended for its free SSL and security features.
    * **Timestamp:** `[00:01:22 - 00:02:05]`

* **Headline:**  Public IP Address Required
    * **Snippet:**  The tutorial emphasizes the need for a public IP address, suggesting a VPS (Virtual Private Server) in the cloud as the preferred hosting solution.  Private IP addresses are noted as incompatible with this method.
    * **Timestamp:** `[00:02:05 - 00:02:34]`

* **Headline:**  Acquiring and Configuring Your Domain with Cloudflare
    * **Snippet:**  The presenter demonstrates acquiring a domain name through Cloudflare and updating DNS configurations to point the domain to their VPS server. Two DNS records are added, one for the main domain and a wildcard entry for subdomains.
    * **Timestamp:** `[00:02:34 - 00:05:42]`

* **Headline:**  Setting Up Nginx Proxy Manager via Docker
    * **Snippet:** The video details setting up Nginx Proxy Manager using Docker Compose on a VPS.  A new directory is created, a docker-compose.yml file is generated, and the manager is started with a single command.
    * **Timestamp:** `[00:05:42 - 00:07:38]`

* **Headline:**  Accessing Nginx Proxy Manager and Adding a New Host
    * **Snippet:**  The presenter demonstrates accessing the Nginx Proxy Manager interface via its IP address and port 81. A new proxy host is added, configured to point to the Open Web UI server using the newly acquired domain name.
    * **Timestamp:** `[00:07:38 - 00:08:57]`

* **Headline:**  Adding a Subdomain for Open Web UI
    * **Snippet:** A second proxy host is added for a subdomain (e.g., `ai.example.com`), directing traffic to the Open Web UI server on port 8080.  The functionality is tested, confirming secure access via the subdomain.
    * **Timestamp:** `[00:08:57 - 00:10:13]`

* **Headline:**  Final Thoughts and Additional Resources
    * **Snippet:** The video concludes by reiterating the benefits of this setup and providing links to other videos detailing Open Web UI installation and local AI model usage.
