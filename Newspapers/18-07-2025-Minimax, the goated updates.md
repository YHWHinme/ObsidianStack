    *   The agent now supports *parallel tool calls*, allowing it to perform multiple actions simultaneously for faster results.
*   **[00:01:05] Self-Developed Browser Agent**
    *   Switched to an in-house browser agent for **enhanced long-term memory**, better stability in long tasks, and improved multi-turn interactions. This is crucial for projects requiring sustained context.
*   **[00:01:25] Cost-Effective Image Recognition & High-Quality Exports**
    *   Image recognition is now **cheaper**.
    *   **State-of-the-art HTML to PPTX conversion** delivers higher quality presentations.

### Revolutionary Backend Services & Customization

*   **[00:01:34] Superbase Integration for Backend Services**
    *   Introduces **Superbase integration** for full database authentication and API support.
    *   Includes built-in *cron jobs* for scheduling tasks.
*   **[00:01:54] New MCP Builder and Agent Marketplace**
    *   A new **MCP (Model, Code, Prompt) builder** allows users to build custom MCPs from scratch or wrap existing tools.
    *   Users can share their creations on the *agent marketplace*, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.

### Practical Demonstrations of New Capabilities

*   **[00:02:10] Demo 1: Investment Research and Analysis Tool**
    *   The agent can build a full-blown investment tool that pulls financial data from APIs like Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage.
    *   Generates company financial ratios, technical indicators, and valuation metrics.
    *   Allows comparison of stocks, custom watchlists, and setting screening criteria, akin to professional financial software.
*   **[00:02:54] Demo 2: Storefront POS App**
    *   Demonstrates building a functional storefront POS (Point of Sale) application.
    *   Handles backend logic, sets up databases, tracks stock and purchases, and prints receipts.
    *   The app is **production-ready** and can be updated by simply uploading an Excel sheet for inventory or sales data.

### Additional Enhancements & Quality of Life Improvements

*   **[00:03:55] Stability and Media Processing**
    *   More stable image generation and external API calls.
    *   Ability to process large batches of media files (images, videos, voice clips).
    *   Improved content concatenation, preventing errors when merging files or data.
*   **[00:04:10] Advanced Browser Agent Context**
    *   Supports a **bigger context window** for reading and understanding longer web pages.
    *   Optimized to bypass anti-crawling measures.
*   **[00:04:22] Web Development Streamlining**
    *   Automated end-to-end validation.
    *   Visual review step to catch UI or content bugs.
    *   Automated image compression for faster site loading.
    *   More stable MCP calls for audio and video tasks.
*   **[00:04:36] Faster Responsiveness & Presentation Tool**
    *   Quicker response speed for the agent's first sentence.
    *   New **PPT agent** generates presentations using a cheaper, more stable model, with export options for PDF, Docs, or PPTX.
*   **[00:04:56] Improved Visualization & Font Support**
    *   More relevant image search results.
    *   Tasks requiring strong visualization now generate full HTML pages.
    *   Python visualization charts now perfectly support **CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) fonts**, a rare feature.

### Conclusion

*   **[00:05:07] Overall Capabilities and Collaboration**
    The Minimax agent continues to improve, capable of web searching, page scraping, browser instance execution, terminal commands, building full-stack applications, and performing deep data analysisâ€”all from a single prompt. It continuously checks and tests built applications for reliable results. Projects can be shared as *playbacks*, allowing others to see the agent's workflow for collaboration or demonstration. The Minimax agent is becoming an increasingly powerful and versatile tool for a wide range of tasks.
