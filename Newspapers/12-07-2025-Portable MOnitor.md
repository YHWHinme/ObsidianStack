**Transcript Reference:** [00:00:00-00:05:51]

* **Step 1:** [00:00:41-00:00:48] Remove the Laptop Screen: Carefully remove the external plastic bezel and unscrew the screen from the laptop casing.  There may be a small connector on the back as well.

* **Step 2:** [00:00:57-00:01:20] Identify the Screen Model Number: Locate the LTN number (e.g., LTN140KT07) on the back of the screen. This number is crucial for finding the correct converter board.

* **Step 3:** [00:01:22-00:01:35] Find and Purchase a Converter Board: Use the LTN number to search on Amazon (or a similar site) for a compatible converter board. This board will allow you to connect the screen to an HDMI source.

* **Step 4:** [00:01:44-00:02:08] Gather Necessary Components:  You'll need the converter board, a 12V to 4A power adapter, and connecting cables.

* **Step 5:** [00:02:08-00:02:28] Connect the Converter Board to the Screen:  Connect the converter board to the screen using the appropriate cable. The connection may be small and fiddly.

* **Step 6:** [00:02:43-00:02:54] Connect the Screen to the Converter Board: Carefully connect the small connector from the screen to the converter board.  Ensure the contact points are pointed down towards the board and make a firm connection.  You can use tape to secure the connection.

* **Step 7:** [00:03:24-00:03:36] Connect Power and HDMI: Plug the 12V power adapter into the converter board and connect an HDMI cable from your computer (or other source) to the converter board.

* **Step 8:** [00:04:23-00:04:50]  Optional: Mounting the Monitor: Decide how you want to mount your new monitor.  The video suggests double-sided tape or a phone mount as options.  Consider creating a more elaborate mount if desired.

* **Step 9:** [00:05:05-00:05:17] Configure Display Settings: Adjust the display resolution (e.g., 1920x1080) in your computer's display settings.
