# Goal 1: Opening a Text Document in Vim (Timestamp: 00:00:13)

**Step 1: Launching NVim**

The video demonstrates launching GVim (graphical Vim) by double-clicking its icon on the desktop.  No CLI commands are involved in this step.

**Step 2: Opening the Text File within GVim**

There are two methods shown:

* **Method 1: Using the File Menu:** Navigate to the "File" menu and select "Open". Then browse and select the desired text file (e.g., `test.txt`).

* **Method 2: Using the Vim Command Line:** Within the GVim window, type `:e <filename>` (e.g., `:e test.txt`) and press Enter.  This executes the `edit` command, opening the specified file.


# Goal 2: Understanding and Using Vim's Copy, Cut, and Paste Functionality (Timestamp: 00:01:00)

**Step 1: Yanking Text (Vim's Copy)**

Vim uses the term "yanking" instead of "copying."  The basic yank command is `y`.  Modifiers are used to specify the amount of text to yank:

* `y<modifier>`: Yanks text according to the modifier.  Examples:
    * `yl`: Yanks one character to the right.
    * `y$`: Yanks to the end of the line.
    * `yE`: Yanks to the end of the word.
    * `yy` or `Y`: Yanks the entire current line.

**Step 2: Pasting Text (Vim's Paste)**

The paste command is `p`.  `p` pastes after the cursor, and `P` pastes before the cursor. The pasted text is retrieved from Vim's internal buffer.


**Step 3: Deleting Text (Vim's Cut)**

Vim's `d` command deletes text, placing it in the buffer. Modifiers work similarly to yanking:

* `d<modifier>`: Deletes text according to the modifier.  Examples:
    * `dw`: Deletes a word.
    * `d$`: Deletes to the end of the line.
    * `dd`: Deletes the entire current line.
    * `D`: Deletes to the end of the line.

**Step 4: Pasting Deleted Text**

After using the `d` command, the deleted text can be pasted using `p` or `P`, just like after yanking.


# Goal 3: Copying Text Between Two Vim Documents (Timestamp: 00:08:29)

**Step 1: Yanking the Text in the Source Document**

In the source document, use `Y` to yank the entire line to be copied.

**Step 2: Saving the Source Document**

Before opening a new file, save the current document using `:w` (write).

**Step 3: Opening the Destination Document**

Use `:e <filename>` (e.g., `:e test2.txt`) to open a new document in Vim.

**Step 4: Pasting the Yanked Text in the Destination Document**

Use `p` (paste after) or `P` (paste before) to paste the yanked text into the new document.
