*   **Right-side modules:** A custom module for displaying system updates [00:01:55], volume control with a popup [00:02:05], system information (disk space, CPU, memory) [00:02:15], a custom logout/reboot/shutdown button [00:02:25], network information, and a clock [00:02:35].
*   Dynamic color adaptation based on the current wallpaper is demonstrated [00:02:45].  Additional modules (Bluetooth, battery, network signal strength) are shown on a laptop configuration [00:02:55].

## Installation and Reloading Waybar [00:03:10]

*   Arch Linux installation instructions using `sudo pacman -S waybar` are provided [00:03:10].
*   Integrating Waybar into Hyperland via the Hyperland config file is explained [00:03:20].
*   A custom script for stopping and starting Waybar instances, potentially loading different configurations based on the username, is shown [00:03:30].
*   A Hyperland keybinding for reloading Waybar after configuration changes is demonstrated (e.g., `super + shift + B`) [00:03:50].

## Configuration Files: `config`, `modules.json`, and `style.css` [00:04:00]

*   The core Waybar configuration file (`config`) is explained, including positioning options (top or bottom) [00:04:00].
*   The `modules.json` file, used for structuring module configurations, is described [00:04:20].  Modules are organized into sections (`modules.left`, `modules.center`, `modules.right`) and groups (e.g., "Hardware").
*   The `style.css` file, containing styling definitions for the modules, is highlighted [00:04:45].  The use of standard CSS commands is noted.

## Waybar Modules: Standard, Hyperland-Specific, and Custom [00:05:00]

*   A review of standard Waybar modules (CPU, memory, disk, network, battery, etc.) is presented [00:05:00].
*   Hyperland-specific modules (workspaces, window title, language, etc.) are mentioned [00:05:15].
*   The creation of custom modules is detailed, using examples such as a Brave browser launcher, a Rofi application launcher, and a custom exit module [00:05:30].

## Advanced Custom Module Example: Updates Module [00:06:00]

*   A detailed explanation of a custom module showing available system updates (using Pacman and yay) is provided [00:06:00].
*   This module features threshold-based color-coding (green, yellow, red) based on the number of updates, with JSON output for styling [00:06:30].
*   The script's logic and JSON output structure are shown [00:06:45].

## Styling with `style.css` and Dynamic Wallpaper Integration [00:07:15]
