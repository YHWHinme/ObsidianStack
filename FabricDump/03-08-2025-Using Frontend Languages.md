# Computer Programming: A Comprehensive Guide

This audiobook, "Computer Programming: From Beginner to Badassâ€”JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, & SQL,"  aims to provide a step-by-step guide to several programming languages, including some introductory black hat hacking techniques.  The book is structured into chapters covering each language individually and culminates in a section on black hat hacking tips.

## Python Programming Guide

**[00:03:00]** Introduction: The introduction congratulates the reader and highlights Python's beginner-friendliness, strong typing, extensive libraries, and the need for continuous learning in software development.

**[00:05:00]** Chapter 1: Installation: This chapter provides detailed, OS-specific instructions for installing Python 3.6.6 or higher on Linux, Windows, and macOS.  It emphasizes the importance of adding Python to the Windows PATH environment variable.

**[00:10:00]** Chapter 2: Interpreters:  Explains the interactive and script modes of the Python interpreter, demonstrating how to run simple calculations and scripts. It also briefly introduces Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

**[00:15:00]** Chapter 3: Data Types and Variables: Covers fundamental data types (integer, float, complex, boolean) and variable declaration and usage in Python.  It explains the `type()` function and variable naming rules.

**[00:20:00]** Chapter 4: Numbers:  A detailed exploration of Python's number types, including Truthy and Falsy values. It introduces built-in mathematical functions (`abs()`, `pow()`, `round()`, `min()`, `max()`) and the `math` module.  It also covers number formatting using the `format()` function.

**[00:30:00]** Chapter 5: Operators: Explains mathematical, relational (comparison), and logical operators in Python, emphasizing operator precedence and associativity.

**[00:35:00]** Chapter 6: Strings:  Discusses string creation, length, escape sequences, concatenation, membership operators, string slicing, and string immutability.  It also covers string methods and the `format()` function for string manipulation.

**[00:45:00]** Chapter 7: String Methods:  A detailed look at various string methods, including those for string testing, substring searching and replacing, string formatting, and string conversion.

**[00:55:00]** Chapter 8: If-Else Statements: Introduces decision control statements, covering `if`, `if-else`, nested `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` structures with illustrative examples.

**[01:05:00]** Chapter 9: Loops: Explains `while` and `for` loops, including the `range()` function for controlling loop iterations.  It also discusses infinite loops and state changes within loops.

**[01:15:00]** Chapter 10: Break and Continue:  Explains the use of `break` and `continue` statements to control loop execution flow.

**[01:20:00]** Chapter 11: Lists: Covers list creation, accessing elements (including negative indexing), mutability, list slicing, membership operators, concatenation, and list comprehension.  It also details built-in list methods.

**[01:35:00]** Chapter 12: Functions: Explains function definition, calling functions, variable scope (local and global), pass-by-value and mutability, positional and keyword arguments, return values, and default argument values.

**[01:50:00]** Chapter 13: Modules:  Describes the use of modules for code organization and reusability, demonstrating how to import modules and access their components.

**[01:55:00]** Chapter 14: Objects and Classes:  Introduces object-oriented programming concepts, including class definition, object instantiation, accessing attributes and methods, and the constructor (`__init__()`).

**[02:05:00]** Chapter 15: Inheritance and Polymorphism: Explains inheritance and polymorphism with examples, showing how child classes inherit from parent classes and override methods.

**[02:10:00]** Chapter 16: Operator Overloading:  Explains how to overload operators within classes using special methods like `__add__()`.

**[02:15:00]** Chapter 17: File Handling:  Covers opening, reading, writing, and closing text files in Python, including error handling for file operations.

**[02:20:00]** Chapter 18: Exception Handling:  Explains exception handling using `try-except` blocks, including handling multiple exceptions and accessing exception objects.

**[02:25:00]** Chapter 19: Tuples:  Covers tuple creation, unpacking, and operations on tuples, highlighting their immutability.

**[02:30:00]** Chapter 20: Sets:  Explains set creation, operations, and the uniqueness of set elements.

**[02:35:00]** Chapter 21: Dictionaries:  Covers dictionary creation, accessing elements using keys, adding and modifying elements, and built-in dictionary methods.


## Black Hat Hacking Tips

**[02:40:00]**  This section details six black hat hacking techniques:  using BREACH to decrypt HTTPS streams, employing DDoS attacking tools (LOIC, HOIC, Slowloris, R.U.D.Y), utilizing the Blue Box method for phreaking, employing Secure Boot to remain undetected, using Bochspwn for kernel vulnerability analysis, and utilizing CreepyDOL for personal tracking.  **_Disclaimer:_** This information is provided for educational purposes only and should not be used for illegal activities.
