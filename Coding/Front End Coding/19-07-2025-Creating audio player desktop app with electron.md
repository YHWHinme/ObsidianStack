dolo# Building a Simple Audio Player with Electron: A Step-by-Step Guide

This video demonstrates how to build a basic audio player application using Electron, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a cross-platform desktop application.

## Setting up the Project [00:00:05]

*   [00:00:05] Create a new npm project using `npm init -y`.
*   [00:00:15] Install Electron: `npm install electron --save-dev`
*   [00:00:25] Create `index.js` (main process) and add a basic "Hello, world!" log to test.
*   [00:00:40] Add a new script to `package.json` to execute Electron: `"start": "electron ."`
*   [00:00:50] Run `npm run start` to verify the setup.


## Creating the Electron Window and Loading HTML [00:01:00]

*   [00:01:00] Import `app` and `BrowserWindow` from `electron`.
*   [00:01:15] Create a `BrowserWindow` with specified width and height (600x280).
*   [00:01:30] Use `app.whenReady()` to ensure the app is ready before creating the window.
*   [00:01:45] Create `index.html` with basic HTML content ("Audio Player App" title and "Hello, world!" heading).
*   [00:02:00] In `index.js`, use `win.loadFile('index.html')` to load the HTML into the window.
*   [00:02:15] Run `npm run start` to see the HTML content in the Electron window.
*   [00:02:25] Explanation of how Electron works using local HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Removing the Menu Bar and Defining Core Functionalities [00:02:40]

*   [00:02:40]  Remove the default menu bar by setting `mainWindow.setMenu(null);` in `index.js`.
*   [00:03:00] Outline the core functionalities of the audio player:
    *   Open an audio file.
    *   Play/pause button.
    *   Time duration display.
    *   Current playback time display.
*   [00:03:30] Show the HTML structure of the audio player in `index.html` (buttons for file open, play/pause, and divs for time display).


## Implementing the Audio Player Functionality [00:03:50]

*   [00:03:50] Create `app.js` to handle the audio player logic.
*   [00:04:00] Get HTML elements and set up an audio element and a variable to track playback status.
*   [00:04:15] Add a click event listener to the "Open File" button.
*   [00:04:30] Explanation of using the Electron API to open a file dialog (not yet exposed).
*   [00:04:45] Create `preload.js` to expose the Electron API securely using `contextBridge`.
*   [00:05:15] Expose `openFile` method in `preload.js` to handle file selection.
*   [00:05:40] Update `index.js` to include the `preload` script.
*   [00:05:55] Handle the file dialog opening in the main process (`index.js`).  Filtering files is shown.
*   [00:06:30] Add click event listener to play/pause button and handle audio playback in `app.js`.
*   [00:06:50] Add event listeners to the audio element to update the play/pause button label.
*   [00:07:00] Create a function to update the time display.
*   [00:07:15] Demonstration of the fully functional audio player.


## Conclusion and Call to Action [00:07:30]
