# Blender Compositor Node Pack: Over 40 Procedural Effects for Blender 4.5

This video showcases a comprehensive pack of over 40 procedural effects for Blender's compositor, leveraging the new features in Blender 4.5. The creator details the effects, their functionality, and how to use them, while also explaining the pack's availability and pricing model.

## Blender 4.5 Compositor Update and New Node Capabilities

[00:00:00] The video begins by highlighting the significant update to Blender's compositor in version 4.5.  The main improvement is that *almost every value in the compositor nodes now has an input socket*. This allows for much more complex and interconnected node setups, especially by connecting values to the inputs of a node group.

[00:00:20]  A few new nodes are also introduced, including the *Image Info node* (for image resolution and transformation data) and the ability to use *procedural texture nodes* from Blender's geometry and shader nodes within the compositor.

## Overview of the Procedural Effects

The video then presents a tour of the various effects included in the pack, categorized for clarity:

### Basic Effects ([00:01:00])

*   *Vibrance*: Boosts saturation of low-saturated pixels.
*   *Vignette*: Adds edge softness.
*   *Tilt Shift Blur*: Creates a tilt-shift effect.
*   *Improved White Balance*: Offers more artist-friendly controls.
*   *Yuba Color Correction*:  Modeled after professional photo editing software features.

### Intermediate Effects ([00:01:45])

*   Drop Shadow
*   Edge Detection
*   Outline Generation
*   Paint Effects
*   Turbulent and Wave Displacement
*   Twirl Displacement


### Animatable Effects ([00:02:15])

*   *Glitch Effect*: Highly customizable and easily animatable.
*   *Shake Effect*:  Generates vectors for motion blur (now using directional blur for better results).
*   *RGB Slide Effect*: Inspired by Video Copilot's Twitch plug-in.

### Generative Effects ([00:03:00])

*   *Lens Flare*: Highly customizable and performance-optimized compared to previous versions. Includes details like brightness falloff and visible lens rim.  Allows customization of lens overlays (dirt, hairs).
*   *Overlay Node*: Generates overlays with falloff towards the edges.
*   *Venetian Blind Effect*: Includes integrated exposure and glow.
*   *Flow Texture Node*: Ideal for creating procedural backgrounds.

### Complex Filters ([00:04:00])

*   *CRT Effect*: Emulates the characteristics of old TVs.
*   *NTSC Effect*: Modeled after an open-source NTSC project (with a free OpenFX plugin available for other software).
*   *VHS Effect*: A completely redesigned VHS effect with customizable signal modulation, noise, tape damage, chroma shift, chroma loss, and displacement effects. Includes a border bus effect for aspect ratio adjustments.


## Pack Organization and Usage

[00:04:45] The pack utilizes Blender's asset library for easy access and preview thumbnails.  Effects are categorized by purpose and function, and nodes are color-coded.  Resource-heavy nodes have a disable toggle for performance optimization.  Default values and input descriptions are provided for ease of use.  Comprehensive documentation is available, including installation instructions and examples.

## Real-Time Compositing and Rendering

[00:05:30] The video explains how to enable real-time compositing in Blender, emphasizing the use of GPU acceleration for faster performance.  It also discusses rendering options, suggesting the use of image sequences over video files for better caching and performance.  The creator notes that the effects are not baked into the render unless explicitly set up that way.  Methods for achieving separate raw and composited renders are detailed.  The use of OpenXR multilayer rendering is also mentioned.

##  Adding Text and Other 3D Elements

[00:06:45]  While the compositor itself doesn't directly support text, the video suggests adding and animating text within the 3D viewport and using it as an input for compositing.  This extends to other 3D objects and tools.

## Pricing and Availability

[00:07:15] The pack is available on Kofi and Gumroad using a "pay-what-you-want" model, allowing for free access.  A fixed-price version is also available on Superhive (formerly Blender Market), with 10% of proceeds donated to the Blender Foundation.  A feedback form is provided for bug reports and feature requests.


## Conclusion

This video provides a thorough introduction to a comprehensive pack of over 40 procedural effects for Blender's compositor.  The creator emphasizes ease of use, performance optimization, and a flexible pricing model that supports both free access and contributions to the Blender Foundation.  The pack's versatility makes it a powerful addition to Blender's capabilities, enhancing its position as a competitor to professional compositing software.
