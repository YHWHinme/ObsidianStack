his video provides a step-by-step guide on how to install Ollama on a Windows system and integrate it with the B.AI DIY application. The main purpose is to enable users to run large language models (LLMs) locally using Ollama and then leverage these models within their B.AI DIY projects.

### Ollama Installation and Initial Setup

*   **[00:00:15] Download and Install Ollama:** The process begins by downloading the Ollama installer from its official website and running the executable file. The installation may take a few moments.
*   **[00:00:48] Verify Ollama is Running:** After installation, Ollama runs in the system tray. Users can check its status and view logs by right-clicking the tray icon and selecting "View Logs."
*   **[00:01:00] Configure Environment Variables:** While not strictly necessary for local installations, setting environment variables like `OLLAMA_HOST` and `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` is crucial for Docker setups or remote server deployments. The video demonstrates how to add these in Windows environment variables.
*   **[00:02:15] Restart Ollama:** After configuring environment variables, it's essential to close and restart Ollama from the taskbar to apply changes.
*   **[00:02:25] Ollama Documentation:** The presenter highlights the official Ollama documentation, specifically the FAQ section, for detailed information on available configuration variables, supported GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD), and a troubleshooting guide for Windows.

### Running an Ollama Model

*   **[00:03:25] Pull and Run a Model:** The next step involves pulling an LLM model using the `ollama run` command in PowerShell. The video recommends a specific model (7B parameters) that works well with B.AI DIY, noting that performance may not match commercial models.
    *   **[00:04:10] Model Selection Tips:** For compatibility with B.AI DIY, it's advised to choose an *instruct model* with *more than 7 billion parameters*.
*   **[00:04:20] Test Model in Console:** Once the model is downloaded and running, users can interact with it directly in the PowerShell console to verify its functionality.
*   **[00:04:45] Useful Ollama Commands:**
    *   `ollama ps`: Lists currently running Ollama models.
    *   `ollama list`: Shows all models downloaded and available on the system.

### Integrating Ollama with B.AI DIY

*   **[00:05:00] Configure B.AI DIY for Ollama:** This section details the necessary configurations within the B.AI DIY application to connect it with the locally running Ollama instance.
*   **[00:05:15] Set Default Context Size:** Users need to adjust the `DEFAULT_CONTEXT_SIZE` variable in B.AI DIY's `.env` file. The video briefly explains how to calculate an appropriate context size based on available hardware, though the example provided is for a larger 13GB model.
*   **[00:06:20] B.AI DIY Settings:**
    *   Navigate to B.AI DIY settings.
    *   Enable **Experimental Providers** under the "Feature" tab.
    *   Scroll down to the Ollama configuration and set the **Base URL** to `http://127.0.0.1:11434` (using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` is crucial for model listing).
*   **[00:07:10] Reload B.AI DIY:** After saving settings, reload B.AI DIY for changes to take effect and for the Ollama model to appear in the list of available providers.

### Testing the Integration

*   **[00:07:20] Run an Example Problem:** The presenter demonstrates the integration by using the configured Ollama model in B.AI DIY to solve a Tic-Tac-Toe game problem, showcasing its ability to generate code.
*   **[00:08:15] Performance and Limitations:** The video notes the chosen model is quite fast for simple tasks but acknowledges that its output quality might not always be perfect for more complex or stylistic prompts.

### Conclusion

The video successfully demonstrates the complete process of installing Ollama on Windows, configuring it, pulling an LLM, and integrating it with B.AI DIY. This setup allows users to leverage local large language models for various tasks within the B.AI DIY environment. The presenter encourages viewers to provide feedback and ask for further assistance if they encounter problems.
